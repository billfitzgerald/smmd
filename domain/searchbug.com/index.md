## How to opt out


Customers can follow our posted opt-out method on our privacy policy page to have their information blocked from being shown on our website. We are also working with our data providers since we are a data reseller not a data broker and do not sell our customer data. We are implementing an internal system to transmit opt out requests to our data vendors (the actual data brokers) who will then remove the information from their system. We are a very small data reseller and plan to creating a new system for opt-outs during the next few weeks.

## How to delete


We already comply with this for California Law enforcement and government officials manually. We typically receive those requests in writing or by email and then manually block that information from being available. We will be implementing a system to transmit those requests to our data providers as well.

## Additional info


Our customers must register on our website to create an account. They are walked through registration and must read and agree to our T&C and privacy policy to open an account. We also have a strict KYC policy and require customers validate their account verbally to ensure they are who they say. We are FCRA and GLBA compliant and do not sell or sell our own customer's data. 

We are not a data broker based on the definition of "Data Broker", however we are a data reseller and sell data from other data brokers. So, to ensure compliance we are registering here. Our sales are well under the $25 million threshold and have fewer than 10,000 customer sign ups annually. We are more of a data validation, data hygiene, and data clean up service but do offer consumer data (just not our own) so we want to make sure we comply with CA laws.
