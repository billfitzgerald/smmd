## Additional info


Freckle collects Data using our proprietary technology (often referred to as a software development kit or “SDK”). We may also collect Data through sever-to-server integrations or other Application Program Interfaces (“API”’s). The integration will enable Freckle to collect data from third-party devices present at certain third-party locations. Such devices may use Wi-Fi, near field communication (“NFC”), or Bluetooth low-energy (“BLE”) beacon technology to transmit signals about the location of Devices to us. Once Freckle obtains this Information, it will transmit that data though an API, in encrypted form, via a HTTPS protocol to its data management platform, make inferences (the “Inferences”), as defined below, about the Device user’s interests.

Freckle uses “pixel tags” and/or “cookies” in order to provide reporting on ad delivery in a pseudonymous manner. Pixel tags are small bits of code that provide delivery information on a webpage. This allows the operator of the page or a third party to collect the IP address of the users of the page. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of a computer that uniquely identify the browser and provide information to the cookie sender. Many websites send cookies to the browsers that are visiting those sites, and many browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. Users can change the browser settings to refuse cookies or to alert them when a cookie has been placed on their browser. The user can check the browser for details in this regard.

Freckle engages in cross device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data from separate devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related. Freckle, or partners that we employ to provide this service, use cross device data to provide reporting on offline attribution associated with cross device advertising.
