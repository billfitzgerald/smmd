## How to opt out


Effective, January 2020, in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, we provide California residents enhanced opportunities to obtain (and if they so choose, correct) their data files, by making verified access requests to us. 

When we receive a consumerâ€™s do not sell request, once verified, the entire data file is removed from our active databases entirely and no longer disclosed to our third party providers; we maintain those names in a suppression file.

Consumers are able to request that we delete their data files that we hold by contacting us by phone, mail, or email. Our privacy policy includes links to an email where consumers can contact ASL and provides all the necessary contact information and directions to make such a request.
