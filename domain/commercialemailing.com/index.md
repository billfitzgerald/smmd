## How to opt out

I do not anticipate my business managing more than 50,000 California consumer records in 2020. As a small broker, my annual sales are not anywhere near $25,000,000 per year. With that being said, I will be recreating my website and providing consumers with a way of opting out of further sales of their personal information. Said website should be up and running by the end of this month.

The method of opt out will be a online submission form that will record address and contact information, that way said information can be used to identify their information and remove it from current and future solicitation or sale.
