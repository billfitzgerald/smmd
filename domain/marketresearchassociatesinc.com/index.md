## Additional info

Most of the data we rent for clients goes directly from the list owner to the print shop (direct mail), a computer service bureau (direct mail or e-mail deployment) or to our client (for telemarketing); not through us. All clients who do telemarketing to consumers have valid SAN numbers and data is scrubbed against the Do Not Call. Direct mail clients use the DMA's Mail Preference Service. Any e-mail data rented to our clients is opt in only. All individuals have the right to know what information is known about them and control over it, including the right to have this information deleted. This is detailed in our Privacy Policy on our website.
